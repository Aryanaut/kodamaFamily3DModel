# kodamaFamily3DModel
Kodamas are small chittering creatures from Studio Ghibli's 1997 film 'Princess Mononoke'. They were my personal favourite creature in the film and I decided to make a 3D model of a family of Kodamas. I made it using Blender and Clip Studio Paint (for reference images). The model is 6cm in height and ready for 3D printing. Take a look!
